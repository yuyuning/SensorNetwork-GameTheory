# SensorNetwork-GameTheory



## How to run
This program required the following external library:
* Apache XSSF: https://poi.apache.org/components/spreadsheet/

User needs to enter basic iformation of the sensor network such as: data storage per node and the energy capacity. After the sensor network has generated, user need to input which amplifier want to modify and enter the amplifier value.

  1. Run SensorNetworkGameTheory.java and follow the steps.
  
  2. Enter the basic information:
